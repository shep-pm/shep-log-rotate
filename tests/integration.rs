//! The tier that drives a REAL shepherd.
//!
//! Everything below `main` has unit tests, and every one of them can pass
//! while this dog loses log lines under load. The rename-to-reopen window is
//! the reason: between the moment a live log is renamed and the moment shep
//! is told to reopen it, shep is still writing through a descriptor that now
//! points at the renamed file. Nothing built out of a fake daemon can say
//! whether those lines survive, because nothing built out of a fake daemon
//! is holding a real descriptor. That is what this file is for.
//!
//! Gated behind the `integration` feature, and needing `$SHEP_BIN` pointed at
//! a built `shep`:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build --release --manifest-path ../pm2-rs/Cargo.toml -p shep
//! SHEP_BIN=../pm2-rs/target/release/shep cargo test --features integration
//! ```
//!
//! # $SHEP_HOME is a temporary directory in every test here, and that is load-bearing
//!
//! A live shepherd runs at `~/.shep` supervising real services. Every test
//! builds its own [`Shepherd`], which owns a `tempfile::tempdir` and kills
//! the daemon it booted when it drops.
//!
//! `--home` alone is NOT enough to keep a test off the real one. `shep
//! adopt` vets a candidate binary by spawning it, with this process's
//! environment and stdio inherited, and killing it about 50 milliseconds
//! later (`shep-cli/src/commands/dogs.rs`, `vet_binary`). An adopted dog
//! reads `$SHEP_HOME` from its environment, so a vetted `shep-log-rotate`
//! whose environment does not carry one connects to `~/.shep` and gets a
//! tick in against the operator's real flock before it is killed. Every
//! command run from here therefore sets `SHEP_HOME` in the child's
//! environment as well as passing `--home`.
