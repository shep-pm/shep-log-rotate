//! The daemon serves this per request rather than caching it, so this dog
//! re-reads it every tick and never caches it either. Changing `max_size`
//! should not need a `shep disable` and `shep enable`.
//!
//! It used to be `[dog.log-rotate]` in `shep.toml`. A shepherd carrying the
//! move reads any such section still there on its first boot, writes it into
//! `dogs.toml` under the bare name, and strikes it from `shep.toml`. The
//! body that reaches this module is unchanged either way, because the
//! daemon serves the table without its header. What did change is the
//! header [`PRINT_CONFIG`] prints: pasting the old one back into
//! `shep.toml` after a migration leaves the same dog named in both files,
//! which the daemon refuses to boot on rather than guess between.
