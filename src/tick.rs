//! One poll of the rotator's loop: read the config, list the flock, rename
//! what has grown, ask the shepherd to reopen, then compress and prune.
//!
//! This is the only module that speaks to the daemon, and it is where the
//! two guards no earlier module could enforce live.
//!
//! The first is a rename guard. A base with no extension and a base whose
//! extension is all digits generate byte-identical names: under `numeric`
//! naming `/var/log/web` rotates into `/var/log/web.1`, which may be the
//! live log of a different sheep whose configured path is literally
//! `/var/log/web.1`. Both readings of that name are correct, so
//! `naming::match_generation` cannot tell them apart and it is not its job
//! to. Only the shepherd knows which paths are being written into, so only
//! this module can refuse, and it refuses by leaving the whole base alone.
//! Renaming a live log out from under an open descriptor is worse than
//! deleting it: shep keeps writing into a path that no longer exists, and
//! the operator's log simply stops appearing.
//!
//! The second is the `protected` [`FileSet`] [`prune::tidy`] takes, built
//! here from every log path the whole flock reported. The collision is
//! between DIFFERENT sheep, so a per-sheep set would miss exactly the case
//! that matters.
//!
//! # This dog rotates its own logs, on purpose
//!
//! A dog is an ordinary supervised entry with a marker, so `ListFlock`
//! reports the metrics dog, the bark dog and this rotator right alongside
//! the flock. Rotating them is the decision rather than an accident that
//! happens to work: dog logs grow like any other, and "your log directory is
//! bounded, except for these four files" is the surprising behaviour. There
//! is no loop, because reopening its own log does not itself cause a
//! rotation.
//!
//! It does mean this dog has to be quiet. A line per file per interval would
//! make its own log the busiest file in the directory it exists to keep
//! small, so [`Report::summary`] returns one line for a tick that rotated
//! something and nothing at all for a tick that did not.
//!

///    taking effect on the next tick.
/// 2. List the flock, and build the protected set from all of it.
/// 3. Stat and qualify every log path, before renaming any of them, so that
///    two sheep sharing one path both see it as it was.
/// 4. Per sheep: rename its qualifying files, then reopen that sheep alone.
/// 5. Only once the reopens are done, compress and prune, and only the logs
///    whose every sheep reopened. Compressing a large log is not quick, and
///    doing it first would widen the stretch during which shep is still
///    writing through its old descriptor. Compressing one whose sheep never
///    reopened would read a file mid-append and then delete what shep is
///    writing to.
///
/// `stop` is consulted from the tidy loop and nowhere else. The renames and
/// the reopens are quick, and a tick interrupted between a rename and its
/// reopen leaves shep writing into a file with the wrong name, which is
/// worse than the wait. The gzip of a large generation is the slow part: it
/// runs on a blocking thread, a stop already requested when its turn comes
/// skips it, and a stop arriving while it runs abandons it. The half-written
/// `.gz` an abandoned gzip leaves is the state the next pass recovers from.
///
/// # Errors
/// - [`Error::Config`] if the `[<name>]` section cannot be understood.
///   Nothing is touched in that case; the tick reads the config first for
///   exactly that reason.
/// - [`Error::Connect`], [`Error::Request`] or [`Error::Protocol`] if the
///   config or the flock listing cannot be had. A refused *reopen* is not an
///   error: it is reported in [`Report::reopen_failed`], because shep is
///   still writing into the renamed file through its existing descriptor, so
///   nothing is lost and the next successful reopen recovers.
///
/// A fault on disk is never an error from here: a rename, a compression, a
/// deletion or a directory listing that fails is that one log's problem,
/// reported in the [`Report`] beside everything else the tick did, and the
/// next log is still handled. Returning it instead would throw the rest
/// of the report away with it, and let one directory's permission bit stop
/// every other sheep's rotation. Only the daemon can stop a tick: a config
/// it cannot read, a request it cannot make, or a reopen it is refused.
///
/// # Panics
/// If `prune::tidy` panics on its blocking thread. The panic is re-raised
/// here with its original payload, so the process fails the way it would
/// have with tidy running in place; the location reported is the tidy
