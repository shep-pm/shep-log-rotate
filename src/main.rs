//! `shep-log-rotate`: a log-rotation dog for shep.
//!
//! One process, one poll loop. Every interval it asks the shepherd for its
//! own `[<name>]` section and for the flock, renames the log files that
//! have grown or aged past what the section allows, asks the shepherd to
//! reopen them, and then compresses and prunes what it rotated. All of that
//! lives in [`tick`](crate::tick::tick); this file is the process around it.
//!
//! # The two questions shep asks the binary
//!
//! Before the loop there is a probe. `shep adopt` spawns this binary with
//! `--version`, reads the build and the `PROTOCOL_VERSION` it was compiled
//! against, and refuses a dog below its own floor; then with `--schema`,
//! and reads a JSON Schema for the `[<name>]` section, which is what lookout
//! draws a settings pane from. Both are answered by
//! [`shep_client::dogs::probe`], from [`Config`]'s own deserialization type,
//! on the first line of [`main`] and before this process opens a socket or
//! a file.
//!
//! Answering is optional in the contract and not optional here. A dog that
//! says nothing to `--version` is adopted with its protocol unknown, and a
//! dog that says nothing to `--schema` has no pane and a section an operator
//! hand-edits. This one was worse than silent before the probe existed: its
//! argument parser refused every flag it did not know, so `--version` got a
//! usage message on stderr and a failing exit status.
//!
//! # How it learns its own name
//!
//! Two names, from two places, and conflating them is how this went wrong
//! once already. See [`Identity`].
//!
//! The handshake name is what goes in the `Hello` frame, and it comes from
//! `$SHEP_DOG_NAME` and from nowhere else. shep sets it in the environment
//! it spawns an adopted dog with, and the daemon records a handshake only
//! for a connection that carries one. A dog that connects anonymously
//! serves every request correctly and is still rendered `silent`, restarted
//! once, and then declared stale and left down. There is nothing to guess
//! at here, and guessing would be worse than not knowing: the name is also
//! how the daemon decides which dog to act on when it refuses a handshake,
//! so a borrowed name restarts somebody else's dog. No `$SHEP_DOG_NAME`
//! means no shepherd spawned this process, and it connects without a name
//! at all.
//!
//! The config name is the `[<name>]` key the settings live under in
//! `dogs.toml`. Getting that one wrong is silent in its own way: the daemon
//! answers `DogConfig` for a name nobody adopted with an empty section,
//! which is byte for byte what a dog running on its defaults gets. Adopt
//! this binary as `logrotate` when it asks for `log-rotate` and every
//! setting in the operator's `dogs.toml` is discarded without either side
//! saying so. It is
//! the handshake name whenever there is one, and [`DEFAULT_NAME`] when
//! there is not, because somebody running this binary by hand still wants
//! their `dogs.toml` read.

shep-log-rotate: a log-rotation dog for shep.

Usage:
  shep-log-rotate                 Run the poll loop. This is what the
                                  shepherd runs after `shep adopt`.
  shep-log-rotate --print-config  Print a commented [log-rotate] block for
                                  dogs.toml naming every option and its
                                  default, then exit.
  shep-log-rotate --version       Print the build and the protocol version
                                  it speaks, then exit.
  shep-log-rotate --schema        Print a JSON Schema for the [log-rotate]
                                  section, then exit.

The last two are what `shep adopt` asks this binary, and they are answered
only as the first argument, which is the only one shep passes.

Settings are read from `dogs.toml` over the shepherd's own socket, never
from this process's arguments. The environment supplies two things and no
more: $SHEP_HOME names the socket, and $SHEP_DOG_NAME names the dog. The
shepherd sets both when it spawns this dog.";

///
/// shep's own two flags are not in here. `--version` and `--schema` are
